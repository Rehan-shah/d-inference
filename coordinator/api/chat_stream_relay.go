// the Responses-format detection latch, the held terminal usage/finish frames,
// and the batch buffer that coalesced chunks are written into before one
// Flush. handleChunk applies exactly the per-chunk pipeline the relay has
// always applied, in the same order; only the write/flush granularity changed.
