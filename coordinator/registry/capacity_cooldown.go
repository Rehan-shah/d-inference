// Capacity-reject routing cooldown.
//
// Prod incident (2026-07): 7 provider boxes (64GB, gemma-4-26b-8bit, v0.7.2)
// rejected 100% of dispatched requests with the capacity string
// ("token_budget_exhausted", classified 503) from their FIRST request after
// registration — ~9,000 rejections in 30 minutes, zero successes — while ~170
// healthy boxes for the same model sat underutilized. The router kept picking
// them because (a) their heartbeats reported near-zero active tokens, so the
// cost-based scheduler scored them best, and (b) capacity-class failures are
// DELIBERATELY invisible to reputation, the shape-keyed inference-error
// breaker (error_cooldown.go skips 503), and the node-health breaker
// (provider_breaker.go ignores capacity sheds). That invisibility is sound
// policy for OCCASIONAL capacity rejects — a busy box must never be punished
// for shedding load — but catastrophic for a box that rejects EVERYTHING: it
// becomes a dispatch black hole.
//
// DISCRIMINATOR — zero interleaved accepts. Transient fullness is NORMAL: a
// saturated box legitimately capacity-rejects while it is ALSO serving. What
// separates pathology from fullness is that a serving box keeps producing
// accepts (first content chunk / clean completion), and any accept clears the
// strikes recorded up to the instant it was OBSERVED (RecordCapacityAccept /
// RecordCapacityAcceptObserved — a strike recorded after that instant is not
// "before an accept" and survives an accept that is applied late). Only
// Threshold-many capacity rejects inside Window with NO accept in between —
// the black-hole signature — trip the cooldown. Keyed per (provider, model) with a struct key (no
// delimiter aliasing), mirroring error_cooldown.go.
//
// RE-PROBE + BACKOFF — TRUE HALF-OPEN. A trip quarantines the pair for
// BaseTTL (default 120s). After expiry EXACTLY ONE request passes as the
// probe: the routing gate opens only while no probe claim is fresh, and
// ReserveProviderEx claims the probe (claimCapacityProbeLocked, under the
// r.mu write lock held for the whole reservation, so concurrent reservations
// serialize) the moment it reserves the pair — every other request keeps
// seeing the cooldown until the probe's outcome lands. Accept → all state
// cleared, the pair is fully re-admitted (a genuinely-full box that recovered
// gets traffic back). Reject → immediate re-arm with an exponentially doubled
// TTL, capped at MaxTTL (default 10 min) — a persistent black hole costs ONE
// bounced probe per cycle, with no thundering-herd leak in the post-expiry
// window. If the probe's outcome never lands (the request died before any
// terminal reached the breaker hooks), the claim goes stale after
// capacityProbeOutcomeWindow and the next reservation may probe again.
//
// NOT bypassed by the selectBestCandidateLockedFull fail-open rescan
// (consistent with the other pair-scoped cooldowns): if every pair for a model
// is capacity-cooled, the fleet genuinely has zero accepting capacity and the
// truthful outcome is the queue/429 path, not a guaranteed-reject dispatch.
// TTLs stagger, so re-probes trickle back on their own.
//
// State is keyed by the provider's STABLE fault identity (faultKeyLocked:
// serial → SE-key → account → session fallback), so a reconnect cannot reset
// a black hole's streak, cooldown, or backoff trip count — the same
// reconnect-proofing as error_cooldown.go and provider_breaker.go. Maps are
// bounded by the same opportunistic >1024 sweep. r.mu discipline and the
// transition-bool return also mirror error_cooldown.go.

// applies changes). All values have safe defaults; setting the threshold to 0
