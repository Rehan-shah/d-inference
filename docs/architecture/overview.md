# System overview — how a Darkbloom request works

> Last updated: 2026-09-03 · commit `5d400cf75`

Darkbloom sells inference on other people's Apple Silicon Macs. A Go
**coordinator** accepts OpenAI- and Anthropic-shaped HTTP requests, picks an
attested **provider** (a Mac running the Swift `darkbloom` CLI), re-encrypts the
request to that provider, relays the streamed answer back, and settles money
between the two accounts. This page names every component and walks one request
through them; each section links to the page that owns the detail.

## Context

The system has to satisfy three parties at once: consumers want a drop-in
replacement for a hosted API (same wire format, same SDKs, lower price);
providers want to earn from idle hardware without exposing it; and neither
party trusts the other or the operator with more than necessary. The design
answer is a thin control plane that never runs a model, a fat client that runs
the model in-process on hardware whose identity Apple can vouch for, and
per-hop encryption so that each party sees only what its role needs
([`security/encryption.md`](security/encryption.md)).

## Components

| Component | Code | Runs where | Job |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coordinator | `coordinator/` (Go) | GCP Confidential VM (AMD SEV); prod `api.darkbloom.dev`, dev `api.dev.darkbloom.xyz` | HTTP API, provider WebSocket, registry and routing, attestation, billing, model catalog, telemetry |
| Provider | `provider-swift/` (Swift; product `darkbloom`) | Operators' Macs, as a LaunchAgent | Connect out to the coordinator, prove identity, run models in-process with MLX, encrypt responses |
| Prompt-contract sidecar | `coordinator/promptsidecar/` (Rust) | Beside the coordinator | Token-boundary planning for prefix-cache routing; failure-isolated |
| Console | `console-ui/` (Next.js 16 / React 19) | Vercel, `console.darkbloom.dev` | Sign-in, API keys, balance, usage, chat, provider dashboard |
| Admin UI | `admin-ui/` (Next.js) | Internal | Read-only operator dashboard over the Postgres read replica |
| Landing | `landing/` (static) | `darkbloom.dev` | Marketing site |
| E2E harness | `e2e/` | CI and developer machines | Full-stack integration and benchmark runs |
| MLX forks | `libs/mlx`, `libs/mlx-swift`, `libs/mlx-swift-lm` (submodules) | Compiled into the provider | The inference engine, pinned by commit |

```

1. **Provider joins.** `darkbloom start` connects outbound to `GET /ws/provider`
   and sends `register` with a Secure Enclave–signed attestation blob. The
   coordinator verifies it (`coordinator/attestation/attestation.go`), assigns a
   trust level, and re-challenges every
   [`DefaultChallengeInterval`](security/attestation.md#layer-2--periodic-challenge),
   allowing [`ChallengeResponseTimeout`](security/attestation.md#layer-2--periodic-challenge)
   for the answer (`coordinator/api/provider.go`). The provider heartbeats every
   [`heartbeat_interval_secs`](../provider/cli-reference.md#providertoml-keys-read-by-the-cli)
   with capacity, slot state, and telemetry; the coordinator's heartbeat timeout
   and eviction rule are in [`scheduling.md`](scheduling.md#heartbeat-cadence-and-eviction).
   Messages: [`../reference/protocol-messages.md`](../reference/protocol-messages.md).
2. **Consumer calls.** Every route passes
   `corsMiddleware → recoverMiddleware → loggingMiddleware → bodyLimitMiddleware`;
   inference routes add `drainGate → requireAuth → rateLimitConsumer →
   sealedTransport` (`coordinator/api/server.go`, `routes`). `/v1/chat/completions`
   and `/v1/responses` share `handleChatCompletions`; `/v1/completions` and
   `/v1/messages` share `handleGenericInference` (`coordinator/api/consumer.go`).
   Routes and shapes: [`../reference/api-contracts.md`](../reference/api-contracts.md).
3. **Admission.** The handler validates the body (size cap
   [`maxInferenceBodyBytes`](../reference/api-contracts.md#limits-and-validation),
   tool-schema normalisation), resolves the public alias to a concrete build
   ([`model-registry.md`](model-registry.md)), reserves the consumer's balance for
   the worst-case output ([`billing.md`](billing.md)), and applies token-rate
   admission ([`../reference/api-contracts.md`](../reference/api-contracts.md)).
4. **Selection.** The registry filters providers through one ordered liveness
   gate (`providerLivenessGateReasonLocked`,
   `coordinator/registry/routing_eligibility.go`) — online, trusted at or above
   the floor, runtime-verified, private-text capable, challenge verified within
   [`challengeFreshnessMaxAge`](routing.md#challenge-freshness) — then scores survivors with an
   estimated-completion-time cost model and reserves the cheapest
   (`coordinator/registry/scheduler.go`). Every rejection has a name from a
   closed vocabulary (`coordinator/registry/gate_reason.go`).
   [`routing.md`](routing.md), [`scheduling.md`](scheduling.md).
5. **Dispatch.** The request body is sealed with a per-request NaCl Box to the
   provider's attested X25519 key (`coordinator/internal/e2e/e2e.go`) and sent
   as `inference_request`. If the first content is late, a speculative second
   dispatch starts at [`speculativeTimerRatio`](routing.md#hedged-speculative-dispatch)
   of the first-content deadline; the coordinator tries at most
   [`maxDispatchAttempts`](../reference/api-contracts.md#timeouts-and-constants)
   providers (`coordinator/api/consumer.go`). [`data-flow.md`](data-flow.md).
6. **Inference.** The provider decrypts in-process, runs the continuous-batching
   engine over the pinned MLX forks, and encrypts every response chunk to the
   coordinator's ephemeral key. [`inference.md`](inference.md),
   [`prefix-cache.md`](prefix-cache.md).
7. **Relay.** The coordinator commits the HTTP response only when the first
   content chunk arrives; failures before that are plain JSON errors, never a
   broken SSE stream. Chunks are normalised and relayed; one trailing extras
   event carries the provider's signature and response hash, then `[DONE]`.
   Post-commit trust and timing appear as `X-Provider-*`, `X-Timing`, and
   `X-Inference-Job-ID` headers.
8. **Settlement.** `inference_complete` carries usage and timings; the
   coordinator charges the reservation's actual cost, credits the provider's
   account, releases the remainder, and records telemetry and a request profile
   ([`billing.md`](billing.md), [`telemetry.md`](telemetry.md),
   [`system-profiler.md`](system-profiler.md)).

## Trust and privacy in one paragraph

Providers hold one of three trust levels — `none`, `self_signed`, `hardware`
(`TrustLevel`, `coordinator/registry/registry.go`). Public traffic requires at
least `MinTrustLevel`, configured by
[`EIGENINFERENCE_MIN_TRUST`](../reference/configuration.md#routing-admission-and-ttft)
(`coordinator/registry/config.go`); at the `hardware` level that means a Secure
Enclave key bound to an Apple Managed Device Attestation chain plus an MDM
posture check; APNs
code-identity attestation additionally proves the running binary is the
released one. The only backend is `mlx-swift` (`BackendMLXSwift`); providers
that proxy text to another process, disable anti-debug, or fail the SIP check
are not routable for private text (`providerSupportsPrivateTextLocked`,
`coordinator/registry/registry.go`). Consumer bodies are decrypted inside the
coordinator's confidential-VM memory for routing and billing and are not logged
or retained; the provider is the plaintext endpoint. Exact conditions:
[`security/attestation.md`](security/attestation.md); exact crypto and what is
retained: [`security/encryption.md`](security/encryption.md).

## Money in one paragraph

The ledger is in micro-USD. A request reserves the consumer's balance for its
worst-case cost before dispatch and settles the actual cost from
`inference_complete`; the provider's account is credited net of the platform
fee, whose value is stated once, in [`billing.md`](billing.md#invariants).
Default per-token prices and the price-resolution order are in
[`../reference/pricing-model.md`](../reference/pricing-model.md). Consumers
fund balances through Stripe; providers withdraw through Stripe Connect. A
consumer routing to a provider it owns (self-route) pays nothing.

## Invariants

1. The coordinator never executes a model; the provider never accepts inbound
   connections from the coordinator (it connects out over `GET /ws/provider`).
2. A provider is routable for public traffic only if every clause of
   `providerLivenessGateReasonLocked` passes; there is no second code path
   (`coordinator/registry/routing_eligibility.go`).
3. Every coordinator → provider request body is a fresh NaCl Box to the key the
   provider attested at registration (`coordinator/internal/e2e/e2e.go`).
4. Nothing is written to the consumer's HTTP response before the first content
   chunk, so a failed dispatch can always fail over or return a JSON error
   (`handleChatCompletions`, `coordinator/api/consumer.go`).
5. Balance is reserved before dispatch (`reserveInferenceBalance`,
   `coordinator/api/inference_admission.go`) and settled from
   `inference_complete` (`handleComplete`, `coordinator/api/provider.go`): the
   difference is refunded, an overage is charged. A request that fails before
   any provider usage is reported is refunded in full (`refundReservedBalance`,
   `coordinator/api/consumer.go`).
6. The provider version the coordinator advertises (`LatestProviderVersion`,
   `coordinator/api/server.go`) equals `ProviderCore.version`; the test
   `coordinator/api/provider_version_sync_test.go` enforces it.
7. Telemetry wire types are mirrored in Go, Swift, and TypeScript and pinned by
   symmetry tests; the ingestion allowlist never admits prompt or completion
   text ([`telemetry.md`](telemetry.md)).
8. Production persistence is Postgres; the coordinator refuses to start
   without `EIGENINFERENCE_DATABASE_URL` unless
   `EIGENINFERENCE_ALLOW_MEMORY_STORE=true` (`coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go`).
   [`storage.md`](storage.md).

## Failure modes

| Failure | What happens | Where described |
|---|---|---|
| No eligible provider for a model | 503 with a structured error before any bytes are streamed; rejection reasons tallied | [`routing.md`](routing.md) |
| Provider slow to first content | Speculative second dispatch; the first to produce content wins; the other is cancelled | [`data-flow.md`](data-flow.md) |
| Provider fails after commit | In-band error event on the SSE stream (the HTTP status is already sent); settlement follows whatever usage the provider reported | [`data-flow.md`](data-flow.md), [`billing.md`](billing.md) |
| Consumer disconnects before the provider finishes | Billing record parked for [`defaultTerminalSettleGrace`](../reference/pricing-model.md#constants), then settled or refunded (`coordinator/api/settlement.go`) | [`billing.md`](billing.md) |
| Attestation challenge fails or goes stale | Provider marked untrusted / `challenge_stale`; leaves routing until re-verified | [`security/attestation.md`](security/attestation.md) |
| Coordinator restart | Providers reconnect with backoff 1 → 30 s; state is in Postgres; trust may be reused within a window | [`components/provider.md`](components/provider.md), [`security/attestation.md`](security/attestation.md) |
