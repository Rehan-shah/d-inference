# v0.8.0 PagedAttention — Live Gate Results

> Last updated: 2026-07-28 · commit `3eefaf1ed`

Measured on Apple M4 Max, 40 GPU cores, 128 GB, 546 GB/s.
Model: `mlx-community/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-qat-4bit` (real weights, 15 GB, 3 shards).
Provider built `swift build -c release`. Medians of **5 repetitions** per point.

## G0b — Does batching pay end to end?

Bar: aggregate ≥ 1.07x of B=4, per-request decode ≥ 22 tok/s.

| B | contiguous agg | paged agg | paged/contig | contig per-req | paged per-req |
|--:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 107.2 | 98.8 | 0.92x | 107.2 | 98.8 |
| 2 | 116.3 | 120.1 | 1.03x | 58.2 | 60.1 |
| 3 | 182.6 | 156.4 | 0.86x | 60.9 | 52.1 |
| 4 | 197.5 | 194.4 | 0.98x | 49.4 | 48.6 |
| 5 | 194.3 | 200.9 | 1.03x | 38.9 | 40.2 |
| 6 | 186.1 | 223.1 | **1.20x** | 31.0 | 37.2 |
| 7 | 199.7 | 222.7 | **1.12x** | 28.5 | 31.8 |
| 8 | 211.1 | 247.3 | **1.17x** | 26.4 | 30.9 |

**B=4 -> B=8 aggregate gain: contiguous 1.069x, paged 1.272x.**

### Verdict: PASS on paged, marginal on contiguous

Both backends clear the per-request floor at B=8 (26.4 and 30.9 tok/s vs a
22 tok/s bar, and far above the `EIGENINFERENCE_MIN_DECODE_TPS=15` production
floor).

The aggregate bar is where they separate. Contiguous gains **1.069x** from
B=4 to B=8 — it lands exactly ON the 1.07x bar, i.e. within noise of not
paying at all. Paged gains **1.272x**.

The migration plan modelled 1.26x for this step. That model is confirmed —
**but only for paged**. On contiguous the same step is worth essentially
nothing.

This is the plan's central claim, now measured rather than derived: *paged is
a batching enabler.* Its value is not a faster kernel — it is slightly
**slower** at B=1 (0.92x) and B=3 (0.86x) — it is that the batch curve keeps
climbing where contiguous flattens. The crossover is at B=5-6.

## Prefill (single sample, 1 iteration)

| tokens | contiguous | paged |
|--:|---:|---:|
| 512 | 990.1 tok/s | 1107.9 tok/s |
| 2048 | 759.0 tok/s | 710.2 tok/s |

Prefill is not a paged win and was never claimed to be — there is no paged
prefill kernel. These are within run-to-run noise of each other.

## G1 — Is paged sized correctly?

Bar: per-sequence paged KV <= contiguous at ctx {1k, 10k, 100k}; pool
footprint fits 36 GB boxes.

### Per-sequence KV, gemma-4 (25 sliding w=1024 + 5 full, fp16)

Derived from the LANDED ring geometry (`ringPageCount = 97 pages = 1,552
tokens`), cross-checked against `PagedKVPool.pageDemand`.

| ctx | contiguous | paged (ring 1,552) | ratio | paged + ring shrink | ratio |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 1,024 | 0.273 GiB | 0.273 GiB | 1.00x | 0.273 GiB | 1.00x |
| 10,240 | 0.977 GiB | 1.077 GiB | **1.10x** | 0.980 GiB | 1.00x |
| 102,400 | 8.008 GiB | 8.109 GiB | 1.01x | 8.011 GiB | 1.00x |

### Verdict: MARGINAL FAIL at 10k, and the ring shrink is what fixes it

Paged overshoots contiguous by **10% at 10k context**. It is at parity at
1k (both under the window) and at 100k (the 5 full-attention layers
dominate and the sliding overshoot washes out). 10k is the worst case
because it is where the sliding ring's extra `maxPrefillChunk` of width is
largest relative to total KV.

The overshoot is exactly `ring - window = 1,552 - 1,024 = 528` tokens per
sliding layer. Shrinking the ring to `window + span` closes it to 1.00x at
every context.

**This promotes `gather(ring) ++ chunk` from an optimisation to a G1
blocker.** It also needs BOTH halves: the layer half is landed, but
row-level direct writers cannot re-gather post-write and need their own
answer.

### Measured, real weights, B=1

| prefill | contiguous | paged |
|--:|--:|--:|
| 1,024 | 1291.2 tok/s | 1299.4 tok/s |
| 8,192 | 861.1 tok/s | 910.1 tok/s |
| 32,768 | 354.3 tok/s | 371.6 tok/s |

Peak RSS at 32k: contiguous 14.914 GiB, paged 14.861 GiB.

Note paged is slightly FASTER at long prefill (+5.7% at 8k, +4.9% at 32k).
The gain is query sub-blocking (WS-0.2p): paged previously built one full
`[l, kL]` score tensor and now blocks at q=128, cutting score-tensor
traffic contiguous had already avoided since #85.

CORRECTION, recorded because this repo repeated it for months and it is
wrong in a way that hides real work. The migration plan said paged could
not help prefill because "there is no paged prefill kernel". There IS one.
`PagedAttentionKernel.supportedHeadDims` is `[64, 128, 256, 512]`
(PagedAttentionKernel.swift:159) and it already runs gemma-4's 512-wide
global layers split two-heads-per-threadgroup. The `{64, 80, 128}` ceiling
that motivated the claim belongs to MLX's FUSED SDPA, which binds only the
prefill path (`attendQueryBlock` -> `MLXFast.scaledDotProductAttention`,
PagedLayerCache.swift:833-835).

What is actually true is narrower and more actionable: the paged kernel is
gated to decode by `precondition(q.dim(2) == 1)`
(PagedAttentionKernel.swift:577), so prefill cannot use it and every
prefill chunk pays a full history copy through `PagedKVPool.gather`, whose
own doc says it "materializes a copy (MLX gathers always do)".

Lifting that gate is not a one-line change: it is a two-pass
flash-decoding design whose `q_smem[HPT * D]` has no token axis, and the
threadgroup-memory budget it would resize is what
`PagedKVBackend.init` refuses shapes on at engine build -- deliberately,
because exceeding `threadgroupMemoryLimit` is an UNCATCHABLE process
fatal. The honest unit is "re-derive the threadgroup budget with a
query-tile axis", which is still far smaller than writing a kernel.

## G0a — Does the coordinator actually dispatch 8?

Bar: `effectiveMaxConcurrencyForModelRateLocked` returns 8 for gemma-4.

Pinned by `coordinator/registry/gate_g0a_test.go` against the MEASURED solo
rates above, not modelled ones.

| input rate | source | quality cap |
|---|---|--:|
| 98.8 tok/s | measured, paged B=1 | **8** |
| 107.2 tok/s | measured, contiguous B=1 | **8** |
| 23.4 tok/s | `sqrt(memory_bandwidth)` fallback | **1** |

### Verdict: PASS, and the reason is load-bearing

`b = floor((tps/floor - 1)/k)` with `floor = 15` (`EIGENINFERENCE_MIN_DECODE_TPS`)
and the re-fitted `k = 0.39` gives the strict quality batch; production then
applies `cap = ceil(b × overcommit)` at overcommit 1.2. A cap of 8 therefore
needs `b` to reach only 6 — `ceil(6 × 1.2) = 8` — which requires
**50.10 tok/s**, not the 61.8 a hand-inversion of `qualityConcurrency` alone
implies. Both backends measure well past it, so there is ~2x headroom.

The test derives this from `soloTPSForCap` rather than restating a closed form,
so the bar tracks `defaultQualityCapOvercommit` if it ever moves.

The third row is the important one. Rev 1 of the plan claimed "no code change
is required to test the batching hypothesis." That was wrong, and this is why:
with no real per-model measurement the coordinator falls back to a
model-agnostic `sqrt(memory_bandwidth)` proxy that reads gemma-4 as ~23.4 tok/s
and pins the cap at **1**. B=8 would never have been dispatched and G0b would
have measured nothing.

So the gate passes *because* a real measurement now reaches the coordinator —
which is the relaxed solo-rate tier added this wave (trust a real solo sample
below the 5-sample floor). A second test pins that dependency explicitly, so
if anyone removes the relaxed tier the failure names the cause instead of
silently reverting the fleet to B=1.

# FINAL GATE RESULTS — all measurable gates

Re-measured after the full completion pass. Apple M4 Max, 128 GB, release
build, real weights.

## G2 — parity, both models, `darkbloom benchmark --parity`

### gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-qat-4bit (+ qat-assistant drafter) — **exit 0**

| criterion | verdict |
|---|---|
| token exactness | UNAVAILABLE — the bar is unsatisfiable, see below |
| MTP | **PASS** — lossless against each backend's own decode; see re-score below |
| packed prefill | **PASS** — active on both backends |
| vision spans | **PASS** — active on both backends |
| prefix reuse | **PASS** — paged 2,816 = contiguous 2,816, bound 25,600 both |

**MTP re-scored, and it moved.** The row above was UNAVAILABLE — "inherited
from the same positions" — when the criterion diffed the two arms' MTP token
streams against each other. That form could not fail here: gemma-4's base
decode diverges on 2 of 3 parity prompts, so every MTP divergence classified
as inherited and the criterion was structurally unable to reach a FAIL on
this model. It now scores each arm's MTP output against that arm's OWN plain
greedy output, which crosses no backend boundary and so inherits none of that
drift. Re-measured on the same box and the same checkpoints
(`--parity-max-tokens 48 --parity-prefix-tokens 28672`):

```
contiguous: driver=true, rounds=5, drafted=5, accepted=4  MTP vs own decode: token-exact
paged:      driver=true, rounds=5, drafted=5, accepted=3  MTP vs own decode: token-exact
```

Drafts were produced AND accepted on both arms, and MTP still reproduced each
backend's plain decode token for token — so the PASS is earned, not vacuous.
The two arms' MTP streams do still differ from each other, but with MTP
token-exact against its own target on both sides that difference is now
*provably* exactly the base-decode divergence `token_exactness` reports,
rather than an attribution inferred from "the base also diverges". Every
other verdict in this table reproduced unchanged, prefix reuse included
(2,816 = 2,816, bound 25,600 both). The run evaluates 4 criteria where it
previously evaluated 3.

Caveat on the bar, so a PASS is not over-read: greedy argmax is a coarse,
non-monotone detector — token-identical is not numerically identical. A
numeric witness cannot simply be bolted on here, because requesting top-k
logprobs on the MTP arm pulls rows off the verification path onto the sampler
and the drafter stops engaging entirely.

### gpt-oss-20b-MXFP4-Q8 — **exit 0**

| criterion | verdict |
|---|---|
| token exactness | **PASS** — 144/144 identical |
| MTP / packed prefill / vision spans | UNAVAILABLE — model facts, not backend faults |
| prefix reuse | **PASS** — paged 26,880 = contiguous 26,880, bound 1,536 both |

**Correction (2026-07-25).** This row previously read "paged 2,304 =
contiguous 2,304". That figure was not wrong, but it was measured at a
DIFFERENT probe length than the gemma-4 table above, and the two were
presented as if commensurable. Prefix saving is fully determined:
`saved = floor((prompt-1)/blockSize)*blockSize - replayBound`, from
`maxLookupBlocks` (grep `maxLookupBlocks`, `BlockHasher.swift`) and
`prefillTokensSaved: replayStart` (grep `prefillTokensSaved`,
`PrefixReusePlan.swift`), with `blockSize` 256 (grep `defaultBlockSize`)
and `replayBound = windowCount * maxWindow`. At `--parity-prefix-tokens
28672` with gpt-oss's 12x128 bound that is `28,416 - 1,536 = 26,880`;
**2,304 is only reachable at a prompt of 3,841-4,096**, i.e. a ~4k probe.
Confirmed three ways: the arithmetic; a clean re-run at
`--parity-max-tokens 48 --parity-prefix-tokens 28672` in which BOTH arms
independently measured `matched=28,416, saved=26,880` (PASS, 26,880 >=
26,880); and `v0.8.0-notes.md` (grep `26,880`), which records 26,880 for
gpt-oss from this same harness. The gemma-4 row above (2,816 = 28,416 -
25,600) IS at 28,672 and is unchanged.

Read the two models' savings as separate measurements, never as a pair:
at one prompt length these numbers are an order of magnitude apart, and
at 4,096 the gemma-4 arm reports UNAVAILABLE rather than 2,816, because
3,840 matched tokens sit below its 25,600 bound and save nothing.

**Zero FAILs. Zero EXPECTED_SHORTFALLs.** Both `EXPECTED_SHORTFALL`
verdicts that existed earlier in this pass disappeared when the cause was
fixed, which is the signal the harness was designed to give.

## Why token exactness reads UNAVAILABLE rather than FAIL

**The bar fails the incumbent.** Changing only
`DARKBLOOM_CBV2_ATTN_QUERY_BLOCK` from 128 to 8 — a shipped operator
latency knob whose own doc says results "can differ in the last ulp" —
makes contiguous diverge from contiguous at token 1 and token 0 on 2 of
the same 3 prompts, with no backend involved.

The in-process control agrees: paged fp32 against paged fp16, same
backend, flips 2 of 3 rows. One position yields **three different tokens
from three configurations of the same weights** — contiguous 100, paged
fp16 107, paged fp32 101.

Root cause is storage-order drift amplified ~1,300x relative to gpt-oss by
gemma-4's attention scale of 1.0 at head_dim 256/512 and its
top-8-of-128 MoE routing across 30 layers. ULP is the ORIGIN, not the
arrival: at the decision the perturbation is 3.657 against a top-2 margin
of 0.604 (6.1x, flips), while the non-flipping prompt is 0.691 against
4.508 (0.15x, holds).

Not a paged defect, and not new:
- paged prefill is **bit-identical** to contiguous — 0.00000 across all
  262,144 logits
- against an fp32 reference, paged is **at parity on sliding layers and
  7-17x MORE accurate on gemma-4's full-attention layers**
- the divergence **predates this wave's ring shrink** — byte-identical at
  the old 97-page geometry

## Gate summary

| gate | verdict |
|---|---|
| G0a — coordinator dispatches 8 | **PASS**, pinned by test; needs 50.10 tok/s, measures 98.8 |
| G0b — batching pays | **PASS** — paged 1.27x from B=4 to B=8, contiguous 1.07x |
| G1 — paged sized correctly | **PASS** — 1.00x contiguous at 1k, 10k, 100k |
| G2 — parity | **PASS** — every evaluable criterion, both models |
| G5 — observable by backend | **PASS** — segmentable end to end |
| G3 — gpt-oss 24h canary | **NOT RUN** — time-based |
| G4 — gemma-4 24h canary | **NOT RUN** — time-based |

## Verdict on the default flip

**The flip shipped. `.auto` resolves PAGED in v0.8.0.**

Every gate that can be measured on one machine passes. G3/G4 are the two
24-hour canary gates and they did NOT run — this migration has no canary
fleet, so there was never a soak to wait for, and holding the default
back for a gate that cannot be executed would have deferred it forever.
The decision was taken on the single-machine evidence above plus the
adoption-exactness result that arrived after this report was first
written: on the two models production actually serves, PAGED is the arm
whose prefix-cache adoption is exact and contiguous is the arm that
diverges. See `case .auto: resolvedKind` in
`EngineV2Factory+Production.swift` for the argument as shipped.

Rollback is `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_PAGED_KV=0`, which degrades every slot to
contiguous without refusing a load.

One product decision was made explicitly rather than inherited from a
green gate: **gemma-4 greedy outputs change under paged.** They are not
worse — measurably more accurate against an fp32 reference — but they are
different. That call was taken by the product owner, not by a test.

# What vLLM does that we do not

Read against `vllm-project/vllm @ b153ae6089e9ec3272c423340d2116da97b904ce`
(2026-07-26). Five agents; every claim below is cited to source and the
sliding-window findings were EXECUTED on this M4 Max, not inferred.

## The root cause of our 25,600-token prefix-reuse floor is the RING

vLLM's minimum prompt for a hybrid prefix-cache hit is **one block, 16
tokens** — not window-granular, not window x layers.

Measured against the real `SlidingWindowManager` and
`HybridKVCacheCoordinator`, built to gemma-4's shape (25 sliding w=1024 +
5 full), on Apple Silicon with no CUDA:

| probe | result |
|---|---|
| 25,600-token prompt, only the last 64 sliding blocks cached | 100% hit, **0 tokens recomputed** |
| p50 = 979 tokens | **976 reused (99.7%)**, sliding identical to full attention |

A sliding-window hit needs only the window-sized CONTIGUOUS RUN of blocks
ending at the hit boundary. Every out-of-window position resolves to a
null sentinel that is never read, because SWA masking already excludes it.
Persist and bound — never replay.

**vLLM's sliding rows are not rings.** They are position-indexed
block-table rows sized to `max_model_len`, whose out-of-window entries are
overwritten with a sentinel and whose physical pages are freed
mid-request. A ring cannot express "positions 0..24,576 are absent AND
that is correct", which is exactly why our cache hit starts empty and
replays. The floor is a consequence of the ring, not of the cache design.

Two related corrections to our own framing:
- **Layers do not multiply.** One `block_id` addresses every layer in a KV
  cache group (`kv_cache_utils.py:1140-1200`). Residency is window-sized.
- **Below the window there is no window requirement at all**
  (`single_type_kv_cache_manager.py:941-949`).

## `retainPage` has zero callers

We built the hard half — a block-granular SHA-256 prefix chain, the same
construction vLLM uses — and never wired sharing to it. Adoption COPIES
the donor's KV into fresh pages instead of aliasing them.

Confining sharing to FULL blocks needs no copy-on-write at all: our
frontier page is private by construction and `256 % 16 == 0` is already an
unconditional invariant. vLLM shipped full-blocks-only for years.

The reservation obstacle is smaller than it looks. vLLM's
`full_sequence_must_fit` mode is structurally identical to ours and
already sharing-aware: **a shared page held by another row costs the
admitting row zero reservation; a shared page sitting free costs one.**
That is reservation arithmetic, not occupancy gating, so our no-throw
guarantee on `CBv2SequenceKV.update` can stay. The work is splitting
`pageDemand`, which today serves three roles at once.

## Our watermark is symmetric; vLLM's is not

vLLM charges its reserve only to WAITING/PREEMPTED requests and only when
the batch is non-empty (`kv_cache_manager.py:459-466`). Ours is one
ceiling for every caller.

So at 95% occupancy a RUNNING decode row asking for one more token throws
`capacityExhausted`, and we preempt — `numComputedTokens = 0`, a
979-token re-prefill. vLLM lets those decodes run into the last 5% and
refuses only new admissions.

This costs us more than it would cost vLLM. Their docs justify
recompute-only preemption on the grounds that "prefix caching being better
(zero overhead) and therefore on by default" makes re-prefill nearly free.
**We inherited the preemption model without the prefix caching that makes
it cheap.**

## Confirmed negatives — do not spend time here

- **Long prefill delaying decodes in the same step: vLLM does not solve it
  either.** Its only knob ships disabled, exactly as our
  `mixedStepPrefillTokenCap` does. Ours is arguably the better design; just
  turn it on.
- **Our SchedulerV2 is already a faithful vLLM V1 port**, and cites vLLM
  line numbers in its own docstrings. Step composition, preemption trigger,
  victim selection, recovery mode and FCFS break-vs-continue are parity.
- **Do not build**: copy-on-write, beam fork (`vllm/core/` is deleted),
  cascade attention (gated off for sliding-window models, needs >= 8
  requests — could never fire for gemma-4 or gpt-oss), block de-dup, or
  SLO-aware admission (vLLM has none).

## Ranked

| # | change | shape |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Asymmetric watermark | two branches |
| 2 | Position-indexed sliding rows + null sentinel — retires the ring | structural, zero CUDA, proven on this machine |
| 3 | Alias on adopt (reuse 2.3% -> ~100%) | hash->page map, `retainPage` caller, split `pageDemand` |
| 4 | Lift `L==1` — kills the prefill gather copy | re-derive the threadgroup budget with a query-tile axis |
| 5 | `ref_cnt == 0` means evictable-but-hit-able | small |
| 6 | Invert PTOK: segment-count constexpr, length at runtime | small; retires the JIT ladder |
| 7 | Hash granularity 256 -> 16-64 · `pendingSamples` skip-don't-break | one line each |

2 and 3 compound: the sentinel design is what makes sliding blocks
shareable at all, and aliasing is what makes sharing free.

## CONVERGED FINDINGS — corrections after peer review

Five agents cross-checked each other and three of the conclusions above
moved. Recorded because the corrected versions are cheaper AND more
precise than what they replace.

### The 25,600 is CORRECT arithmetic, not a mis-derivation

Withdrawn: "a design artifact, not physics." It is the RECEPTIVE FIELD of
25 stacked sliding layers of width 1024 — recomputing position p exactly
needs correct hidden states N·W tokens back, and depth compounds the cone
linearly (`CONTRACT-DECISIONS.md:15`). Those are real forward-pass tokens:
`replayStart` feeds `rec.numComputedTokens` and the scheduler chunks
`[C, M)` as ordinary prompt.

The two findings reconcile once you see they measure different things:
- "layers do not multiply" is about STORAGE — one block id addresses every
  layer in a group, so residency is 1x not N x.
- N·W is about NUMERICAL EXACTNESS UNDER RECOMPUTE.

**Storing windowed KV costs 1x and eliminates the N x replay entirely.**
That is exactly why vLLM's number is ~0: it never recomputes a windowed
layer.

### The 2.3% has an exact mechanism: the planner REFUSES

At any `M <= 25,600`, `cbv2RequiredRecompute` returns `M`, so
`replayStart = 0` and `PrefixReusePlan.swift:218` returns **nil**. Not a
weak plan — no plan. At p50 979 tokens we are ~26x under the threshold, so
the refusal is unconditional rather than marginal.

### FOUR of the five links are already built

The windowed-restore chain, verified end to end:

| # | link | state |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | planner flag `restoringWindowsAtBoundary` | built, **tested** (2 callers pass true), no production caller |
| 2 | plan with R=0 (`requiresExactWindowRestore`) | built, tested |
| 3 | backend restore branch | built |
| 4 | row-side install (`PagedKVBackend.installWindow:462-477`) | **built and live** |
| 5 | the BRIDGE that supplies the payload | **MISSING** |

The provider half is built and tested too: `adoptionBoundTokens` returns 0
under `.restoredFromSidecar`, pinned at `replayed == 25_600,
restored == 0` on the real gemma fixture.

Link 5 is: fetch `SSDPrefixCache.stagedWindow(requestID:)` (:1810, never
called), bridge each window to `CBv2PagedWindowSnapshot`, place it at the
windowed layer indices, pass `restoringWindowsAtBoundary: true`, and flip
`pagedWindowRestoreLanded` — the deliberate fail-closed gate whose comment
already describes exactly this condition.

**So this is payload plumbing between two built halves, not new
machinery.** The refusal path is already proven: `makeFrozenFullState`
validates every layer before reserving a page and throws rather than
half-installing; `applyAdoption` catches and cold-prefills.

### The Apple-specific constraint, in one line

On Metal the query tile and the simdgroup count are NOT independent knobs.
They are one budget imposed by the 32 KB threadgroup cap:

> **`BLOCK_Q · (1 + NSG) <= 8`**

because `headsPerThreadgroup` caps `hpt·D` at 1024 floats, making the
total `≈ 4 · BLOCK_Q · 1024 · (1 + NSG)` bytes — essentially independent
of head dim. Verified: predicted 20,480 vs actual 20,544 (D=512) and
20,608 (D=256).

`BLOCK_Q = 4` lands on **32,832 B** — byte-identical to a process fatal
this codebase already shipped and fixed ("sizing these by GQA is exactly
the bug that made Gemma-4 global layers a 32,832 B process fatal").
Whoever takes the L==1 work would re-introduce it to the byte. Put that
number in the ticket.

vLLM's `BLOCK_Q = BLOCK_M // num_queries_per_kv` has no such coupling.
**The M-axis packing technique ports; the freedom to size it does not.**

### Rank 1 is worth strictly MORE to us than to vLLM

Sharpened from "probably" to exact. Our preempt path clears the plan —
`SchedulerV2.swift:782-783` sets `numComputedTokens = 0` AND
`prefixReusePlan = nil` — and the planner refuses any plan below 25,600.
So a preempted 979-token row replays **all 979 tokens with certainty**,
not in expectation.

vLLM's recompute-over-swap choice rests on prefix caching absorbing the
re-prefill. On gemma-4 that premise is not merely weaker for us — it is
structurally inapplicable. Which inverts the naive reading of this whole
exercise: the asymmetric watermark is worth more here than it is upstream.

### Sequencing note

The sentinel item and the L==1 item are independently sized but their
failure modes are coupled, one way. Today's poison pad fails SAFE by being
unreachable; a sentinel inside a valid range fails OPEN if the mask is
wrong, because zeros are not neutral in a softmax (exp(0)=1). That
analysis assumes BLOCK_Q=1 — which is exactly what the kernel work
changes. With a query tile, one tile spans rows at different absolute
positions, so the mask stops being a tile-level property.

vLLM splits this deliberately: `compute_tile_loop_bounds` prunes whole
tiles using the UNION across the Q-block (an optimisation), and
`compute_kv_seq_mask` masks per ELEMENT with a per-row `query_abs_pos`
(the correctness argument). Conflating them is the bug, and it only
becomes possible once BLOCK_Q > 1.

Cheapest order: sentinel first at BLOCK_Q=1 semantics, kernel second, with
the re-proof owned by the kernel ticket.

## FINAL corrections — three claims above are wrong

### 1. The M-axis amortisation win is UNAVAILABLE, not merely constrained

There is a tighter budget than the 32 KB threadgroup cap: the per-thread
REGISTER accumulator, `maxAccumulatorFloatsPerThread = 32`
(`PagedAttentionKernel.swift:387`). It is **already exactly saturated at
both gemma-4 head dims**:

    global   D=512, hpt=2  ->  2 x 16 = 32 floats   (at cap)
    sliding  D=256, hpt=4  ->  4 x  8 = 32 floats   (at cap)

Not a coincidence — `headsPerThreadgroup` picks the largest divisor of GQA
that lands on the cap. gemma-4 is GQA 8 at both dims
(`Gemma4Text.swift:147,:154`), so this holds unconditionally.

A query tile gives every token its own `m`/`l`/`acc`, so per-thread floats
become `BLOCK_Q · HPT · D/32`, i.e. **`BLOCK_Q · HPT <= 1024/D`** — at
most 2 on global layers, 4 on sliding.

The KV tile a threadgroup loads is amortised across exactly `BLOCK_Q ·
HPT` rows of the M axis, and that product is PINNED. **Adding a token to
the tile costs exactly one head.** vLLM's `BLOCK_Q = BLOCK_M //
num_queries_per_kv` works because M is a free 16 rows; ours is a fixed
budget already spent in full.

So the unified-kernel amortisation argument is dead at our head dims.
Item 4 still ranks where it does, justified by exactly ONE thing:
**eliminating the prefill gather round-trip**, which is independent of
tile shape and survives all three narrowings.

The two limits also bind differently, which is worth keeping: threadgroup
memory is an uncatchable process fatal refused statically; the register
cap is a validated level, so exceeding it degrades rather than crashes.

### 2. vLLM has the same coupling — the FAILURE MODE is the delta

Withdrawn: "vLLM's BLOCK_Q has no such coupling."
`triton_unified_attention.py:932-935` pins `BLOCK_M = 16` and derives
`BLOCK_Q = BLOCK_M // num_queries_per_kv`. Since `BLOCK_M = BLOCK_Q · gqa`,
both systems hold the product of query tile and head split constant. The
query tile is not a free knob there either, and vLLM's one hand-tuned
exception is gated to Blackwell.

What actually does not port:

> Ours is a **static compile-time refusal**, because overrunning the
> threadgroup limit is an uncatchable process fatal. Triton allocates
> shared memory itself and **degrades occupancy** instead of dying.

The technique ports. The tile does not, and the failure mode is the reason.

### 3. Windowed restore does NOT reduce preemption cost — the two items are complementary

The tempting inference — "once link 5 lands, adoption succeeds with zero
replay, so preemption stops being expensive" — is **false**.

`applyAdoption` has exactly ONE call site in the engine
(`EngineLoopV2.swift:853`), fired on the submit path immediately after
`scheduler.enqueue`. There is no adoption attempt anywhere on the resume
path, and the preempt path destroys the plan outright
(`SchedulerV2.swift:782-783` sets `numComputedTokens = 0` AND
`prefixReusePlan = nil`).

**A preempted row has permanently passed the only point at which adoption
could occur.** It cold-prefills its full sequence on resume,
unconditionally, whether or not link 5 ever ships.

So the asymmetric watermark and windowed restore are complementary:
restore reduces cold-start cost for NEW requests; the watermark reduces
how often ESTABLISHED rows are destroyed. Neither discounts the other.

A FIFTH delta falls out of this, and it is the mechanism behind vLLM's
confidence in recompute-over-swap: **vLLM re-enters the prefix-cache
lookup on resume.** Its waiting-loop lookup is gated on
`num_computed_tokens == 0` (`vllm/v1/core/sched/scheduler.py:718`), which a preempted request
satisfies precisely because `_preempt_request` zeroed it. There is a test
named for the behaviour. We structurally cannot — and making it possible
is new work at the submit-only call site, not a side effect of link 5.

### 4. Granularity is 16 OR 32 tokens, not a flat 16

gemma-4's head dims are asymmetric (256 sliding / 512 global), so vLLM's
`unify_kv_cache_spec_page_size` scales the sliding block up to 32 and
`scheduler_block_size = LCM(32,16) = 32`. With `attention_k_eq_v` set the
pages re-equalise and both stay 16.

p50 reuse is 98.1% or 99.7% respectively — either way 800-1600x below our
25,600. And the sliding contiguous-run requirement is 1024 tokens in BOTH
geometries: it tracks the WINDOW, not the block size, and only binds above
the window, which our p50 is not.

Sharper framing for the ring: **a ring has no absolute position to install
a window AT**, which is exactly what makes link 5 awkward to feed.
`installWindow`'s `row.fastForward(to: snapshot.base)` is the
absolute-positioning primitive, and it is the property vLLM gets for free
from position-indexed rows.

## LAST correction — the amortisation claim was wrong for 25 of 30 layers

The "already exactly saturated at both head dims" finding above was read
off the Swift decoder DEFAULTS (`numAttentionHeads 8 / numKeyValueHeads
1`). Those are placeholders and they disagree between MLXLLM and MLXVLM.

The real config, read independently from the checkpoint on disk AND
present in-repo as a verbatim literal (`CBv2LastQueryPrefillTests.swift:774-791`):

    num_attention_heads 16   head_dim 256    num_key_value_heads 8
    global_head_dim 512      num_global_key_value_heads 2
    attention_k_eq_v true    sliding_window 1024   30 layers

So the two layer families are ASYMMETRIC and only one is saturated:

| | D | GQA | hpt | acc | headroom |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| sliding (25L) | 256 | **2** | 2 | 16/32 | **2x free** |
| global (5L) | 512 | 8 | 2 | 32/32 | at cap |

Recomputed against `headsPerThreadgroup` / `partThreadgroupBytes` directly
(`maxAccumulatorFloatsPerThread = 32`, `threadgroupMemoryLimit = 32768`,
`mergeRecordMetaFloats = 2`):

    sliding  BQ=1: acc=16/32  NSG=8  18,560 B  M-rows=2   <- today
             BQ=2: acc=32/32  NSG=4  20,608 B  M-rows=4   FITS
             BQ=4: acc=64/32                              register spill
    global   BQ=1: acc=32/32  NSG=4  20,544 B  M-rows=2   <- today
             BQ=2: acc=64/32                              register spill
             BQ=4:                            32,832 B    FATAL

`BQ=4` on global is still byte-identical to the historical process fatal.

**Corrected statement:** the M-axis amortisation win is unavailable on the
5 global layers and a 2x on the 25 sliding layers — which is where p50
traffic lives.

**A cost that has not been priced:** `BQ=2` on sliding forces `NSG` from 8
down to 4, because the merge buffer scales with both. It trades simdgroup
parallelism for M-axis amortisation. Whether that is net positive is a
MEASUREMENT, not a derivation, and nobody has run it. Do not file this as
a free doubling.

For scale: at GQA=2 vLLM's formula gives `BLOCK_M=16`, `BLOCK_Q=8`, so 16
M-rows against our reachable 4.

## Link 5 is bounded by disk budget, not just plumbing

Two numbers from our own source that belong next to the "it is only a
bridge" framing:

- A sliding snapshot is `windowCount x window` positions of real K/V —
  **200 MiB per gemma-4 donation** (`CBv2SlidingWindowDonation.swift:10-11`).
- The box-wide SSD budget is **20 GiB across ALL models**
  (`PrefixCachePolicy.swift:53`, clamped to `min(20 GiB, free/2)`).

That is ~100 sidecars for the entire box, competing with the
full-attention blocks already using that budget.

And the two effects interact adversely: flipping the gate collapses
`adoptionBoundTokens` to 0, which drops the donation floor to just
`minEffectiveTokens` — so donation VOLUME rises sharply at the same moment
each donation becomes 200 MiB more expensive. Uncosted.

Link 5 still ranks first — it trades bandwidth we have against forward
passes we do not, and it unblocks the 2.3%. But it is "bounded by a 20 GiB
box-wide budget at ~200 MiB per sidecar," not "cheap."

Also: link 5 restores BY COPY into private pages (`installWindow` ->
`fastForward` + chunked `write` -> `ensurePage` -> `allocatePage`).
It is independent of `retainPage`/refcount>1 sharing and moves
`pagesInUse` toward sharing by exactly zero pages. The two items do not
substitute for each other.

## Closing three items

### The kernel constraint is REGISTERS, in a cleaner form

Supersedes `BLOCK_Q · (1 + NSG) <= 8`, which was the wrong bound (it was
threadgroup memory, and it was not head-dim independent). The binding
constraint is the per-thread accumulator, and it drops out clean —
independent of GQA and of NSG entirely:

> **`BLOCK_Q · hpt <= 1024 / headDim`**

    global   D=512  ->  M <= 2   today M=2   ALREADY AT CAP, BLOCK_Q pinned at 1
    sliding  D=256  ->  M <= 4   today M=2   room for BLOCK_Q=2

Same conclusion as before, correct mechanism, correct per-family numbers.
vLLM's `BLOCK_Q = BLOCK_M // num_queries_per_kv` has neither coupling.

`BLOCK_Q=4` is NOT a further win on sliding, and the reason is worth
pinning so nobody re-scopes it: at `HPT=2` it needs 64 accumulator floats
against a budget of 32 (memory fits at 24,704 B — registers bind first),
and at `HPT=1` it fits both but yields M-axis `4 x 1 = 4`, IDENTICAL to
`BLOCK_Q=2 / HPT=2`, while doubling the threadgroup splits. Memory
headroom on the sliding layers is real and is not available amortisation.

### The granularity number is 32 tokens, and the scaling runs the other way

Read from the operator's actual checkpoint, identical across the
4bit/8bit/qat copies on this box. Per-token KV is **sliding 8192 B**
(2·8·256·2) vs **global 4096 B** (2·2·512·2) — sliding is the BIGGER page,
so vLLM's unify scales the GLOBAL block up, not the sliding one:

    sliding blk 16 x 8192  =  global blk 32 x 4096  =  131,072 B
    scheduler_block_size = LCM(16,32) = 32 tokens     hash granularity = GCD = 16

> **gemma-4-26B-A4B minimum prefix-reuse granularity under vLLM: 32 tokens.
> Ours: 25,600. Ratio 800x.** p50 979 -> 960 reusable (98.1%).

Structural note: vLLM forms **six** KV cache groups for this model, not
two. `group_size` is the min layer count (5), and 25 is not < 5·1.5, so the
sliding layers split into five 5-layer groups plus one full group. They
collapse to two SpecGroups for lookup, and a block counts as cached only if
present in all five sliding group ids at once. The group abstraction is
sized by the REPEATING PATTERN, not by attention type — which is what keeps
per-block residency at 1x instead of N-layers x.

### Link 5 and block sharing are SEQUENCED, not independent

The 20 GiB / 200 MiB ceiling is a cost of OUR chosen restore mechanism —
copy whole windows to an SSD sidecar — not of the capability. vLLM pays
nothing extra: the windowed K/V it reuses is the same in-pool blocks the
request already holds, retained by refcount rather than copied to disk.

**If sharing lands, link 5's payload can come from live pages and the disk
budget stops binding.** Do not rank them as two separate wins that each
need paying for.

### And the watermark must land FIRST

Donation does not stall steps — `enqueueDonation` hands the work to a
serial `.utility` queue off the critical path. But **donor pages stay
pinned out of the pool until the donation materialises**:
`releaseDonationStateOnEngineQueue` runs only after `donate` returns.

Link 5 raises donation VOLUME (the floor collapses to `minEffectiveTokens`)
and donation SIZE (~200 MiB of sliding snapshot) simultaneously, on a
deprioritised serial queue — so the backlog grows exactly under load. More
retired rows pinning more pages shrinks the free pool, which is precisely
the condition that makes our symmetric watermark preempt RUNNING decodes.

> So link 5 does not merely fail to reduce the watermark's value — it
> **increases** it, transiently, at peak donation churn.

**Land the asymmetric watermark before or with link 5, never after.** Under
today's symmetric ceiling that pressure converts directly into preemptions
which are deterministically full-cost on gemma-4. With it, the same
pressure expresses as deferred admissions.

### Refinement: sharing moves the tiling, it does not remove it

Block sharing lifts the 20 GiB disk ceiling, but the reason sidecars tile
is a property of RINGS, not of disks. `SSDPrefixCache.swift:1146-1152`
states it:

> a donor's ring holds "exactly the last W positions ending at its own
> absolute offset, which is a mid-block position for all but 1 in
> blockSize requests... Successive donations end at different offsets and
> their covered ranges TILE, which is what eventually completes a
> boundary's window. A boundary whose tiling is incomplete is simply not
> restorable, and the adopter replays."

A finished donor's ring holds one window ending at ITS final offset.
Sharing those pages by pointer serves adopters matching at that boundary;
every other boundary still needs coverage from some other donor.

So: **link 5 unblocks the capability and is bounded by disk; block sharing
lifts the disk bound and improves tiling density; neither removes the
requirement that a boundary's window be fully covered before it is
restorable.** Where vLLM does better here it is a population effect —
many concurrent requests' retained blocks tile naturally in-pool — not an
absence of the requirement.

## Provenance

Five agents, read against `vllm-project/vllm @ b153ae6089` (2026-07-26).
The gemma-4 geometry is confirmed by three independent sources: the
operator's checkpoint on disk and a verbatim in-repo literal
(`CBv2LastQueryPrefillTests.swift:775-791`) that cannot go vacuous.
The sliding-window measurements were EXECUTED on this M4 Max against
vLLM's real `SlidingWindowManager` and `HybridKVCacheCoordinator`.

Every headline claim here survived being challenged by a peer, and the
corrections above are the ones that survived challenge in turn. Ten
substantive claims were retracted during review, including four of the
five agents correcting their own submitted findings. Three agents cited
the wrong checkout at some point — root cause is that the default cwd has
no top-level `PagedKVPool.swift`, so path resolution silently lands in
`.claude/worktrees/release-v070/`, where `pageCount`/`usablePageCount`
differ semantically. That is a standing hazard for anyone working across
these four trees.

---

## The root cause, one level below everything above

Both the 25,600 floor and the tiling requirement are the same defect seen
twice:

> **vLLM's shareable unit is an ABSOLUTELY-POSITIONED BLOCK. Ours is a
> window snapshot defined relative to where a donor stopped.**

vLLM: `block_hashes[i]` covers tokens `[i·bs, (i+1)·bs)` counted from
token 0 and chained from token 0 (`kv_cache_utils.py:691-749`); SWA's hit
scan indexes those same absolute `i`
(`single_type_kv_cache_manager.py:912-916`); blocks are cached as they
fill. So ONE donor of length L caches a block at every absolute index in
`[0, L/bs)`, and an adopter matching at any boundary `M <= L` finds its
entire contiguous window inside that single donor's output.

Ours: a donor's ring holds the last W positions ending at ITS offset, so
coverage must be assembled by tiling across donors that happened to stop
at complementary places.

**Coverage in vLLM is a function of what was COMPUTED. Ours is a function
of where donors STOPPED.** The first composes trivially; the second
requires a coincidence.

Honest bound on the claim: vLLM can be configured sparse
(`VLLM_PREFIX_CACHE_RETENTION_INTERVAL`, defaults to None = dense), and
under sparsity some boundaries genuinely are not restorable — which is why
`shared_prefix_boundary` exists to pin junctions. So the coverage
requirement is real in both systems. The difference is **vLLM pays it only
when it opts in; we pay it unconditionally, because rings carry no
absolute position.**

This corrects the "population effect" framing above: vLLM's advantage here
is architectural, not statistical.

Practical consequence — it reinforces the ordering (link 5 first, sharing
second) but resizes the second item. Moving to absolutely-indexed shared
blocks does not merely lift the 20 GiB disk ceiling; it **removes the
tiling requirement itself**, which is the larger effect and is the actual
reason vLLM's floor is one block.

### CORRECTION to the section above: it is capture policy, not addressing

The "rings carry no absolute position" framing is WRONG and is retracted.
Our ring IS absolutely indexed: the slot for absolute position `p` is
`(p / pageSize) % ringPages`, a pure function of `p` and donor-independent
— `PagedSequenceKV.swift:11-13` states it as a bijection onto
`p % (ringPages · pageSize)`, and `gatherRange` calls the resulting page
list "the CANONICAL slot of every requested position." Two rows at the
same absolute positions occupy the same ring slots.

The actual cause is **bounded retention plus end-of-life capture**. The
donor computed `[0, L)` but the ring physically holds only the last
`ringPages · pageSize` positions, so at donation time only a trailing
window survives to be snapshotted. So:

> vLLM caches blocks **as they fill** — dense, every absolute index
> (`cache_full_blocks`), and gets sparse only when `retention_interval`
> opts in. We snapshot **what a row still holds** at donation.
> **Same axis, opposite default. The delta is capture-time policy, not
> coordinate systems.**

That is independently fixable here without touching the ring, and our own
geometry says there is room: `ringPageCount` gives gemma-4 sliding 65
pages = **1,040 tokens** of residency against a **256-token** prefix block
(`BlockHasher.defaultBlockSize`). A block written during prefill stays
resident about **four block-times** before the ring laps it. Capturing
windowed blocks as they fill is geometrically available; nothing forces
the once-at-the-end snapshot that creates the tiling requirement.

This also revises the 200 MiB / 20 GiB caveat DOWN in importance: 200 MiB
is the cost of persisting a whole window per donation, which is an
artifact of end-of-life snapshotting rather than of the capability.

### How to cost item 4 honestly

- **Gather-round-trip elimination** — unambiguous, tile-shape independent,
  survives every correction in this document. Rank on this alone.
- **2x M-axis on the 25 sliding layers** — real, but paid for with NSG
  8 -> 4, and UNMEASURED. It is budget arithmetic from verified constants,
  not a benchmark. Treat as a hypothesis to test after the kernel exists,
  never as a projected speedup.
- **The 5 global layers** — nothing. `BLOCK_Q` is pinned at 1 outright.

The scheduler-side mechanism, which makes "as they fill" literal rather
than a figure of speech: capture is driven from the step loop on EVERY
step, not at request end. `AsyncScheduler._update_request_with_output`
calls `kv_cache_manager.cache_blocks(request, num_computed_tokens -
num_output_placeholders)` (`async_scheduler.py:70-72`), gated on the
request having been RUNNING, so each step's newly-filled blocks are hashed
and published as that step completes.

Dense is confirmed as the default and sparsity as opt-in: the retention
interval is sourced from `VLLM_PREFIX_CACHE_RETENTION_INTERVAL`
(`kv_cache_coordinator.py:124-125`, unset -> None -> dense) and **only SWA
and Mamba act on it** (`single_type_kv_cache_manager.py:416-419`).

So the contrast is exact:

| | when blocks are published |
|---|---|
| vLLM | incrementally, from the step loop, as they fill |
| us | once, at retire, from the donation queue (`EngineLoopV2.swift:2109`) |

That is upstream of the 200 MiB / 20 GiB sidecar caveat rather than beside
it, and it is why vLLM's sliding-window coverage does not depend on
donors' final offsets tiling.

### What this does to the ranking: producer vs consumer

Capture-as-you-fill pays **per block** instead of persisting a whole
window at end of life, which collapses the disk ceiling AND the tiling
requirement at once — the two caveats attached to the sharing item above
are the same artifact seen twice.

That resolves into a cleaner structure than the flat ranking above:

| role | item | without it |
|---|---|---|
| **consumer** | link 5 — bridge `stagedWindow` into the restore path | capability stays dark; the planner refuses |
| **producer** | capture windowed blocks as they fill | coverage depends on donors' final offsets tiling, and each donation costs 200 MiB against a 20 GiB box |

**Both are needed, and the producer determines how much the consumer is
worth.** Link 5 against end-of-life capture works but is tiling-limited
and disk-bound. Link 5 against dense capture is the regime vLLM actually
runs in.

vLLM demonstrates dense capture is a real operating point rather than a
hypothesis, and our geometry permits it without touching the ring (~1,040
tokens of sliding residency against 256-token blocks — about four
block-times of resident life per block).

So the corrected reading of item 3 is not "wire block sharing." It is
**move capture from retire-time to step-time**, which is the same change
vLLM made and the reason their floor is one block.

### SUPERSEDED: vLLM has no tiling requirement at all

The "sharing moves the tiling, it does not remove it" section above is
retracted. It was reasoned from our ring; it was then MEASURED against
vLLM's real `KVCacheManager` and is false.

One donor, 8,192 tokens, window 1,024, run in 512-token chunks with
`remove_skipped_blocks` firing each chunk, then freed. Adopters at
boundaries far behind the donor's final offset:

    boundary 1024 -> 1008/1008    boundary 6144 -> 6128/6128
    boundary 2048 -> 2032/2032    boundary 7168 -> 7152/7152
    boundary 4096 -> 4080/4080    boundary 8192 -> 8176/8176

Every boundary at the theoretical maximum. The donor's LIVE window at the
end covered only `[7168, 8192)`, yet all of `[0, 8192)` stayed adoptable.
(The uniform 16-token shortfall is `max_cache_hit_length = num_tokens - 1`
— the last token must recompute for logits. Not a gap.)

Mechanism: `cache_blocks` inserts every full block at its ABSOLUTE index
as it fills, and `remove_skipped_blocks` frees the physical block while
**`free_blocks` never removes the hash-map entry** — so history stays
hit-able and `touch()` resurrects it.

The real bound, also measured: shrink the pool to 600 blocks against 512
blocks of donor history and boundaries 1024 and 4096 return hit=0, with
only the tail surviving. **So the limit is LRU eviction — graceful
degradation under pressure, not absence by construction.** A far weaker
constraint than tiling.

Which means the tiling requirement is entirely OUR artifact of end-of-life
capture, and dense capture removes it rather than relocating it.

### Implementation hazard: capture must run INSIDE the chunk

"Four block-times of headroom" is true for the default config but is NOT
a property of the system, and the safe-sounding form is the wrong one.
Capture runs per prefill CHUNK, and the ring is sized FROM the chunk:

    ringPageCount = ceil(max(maxWindowExposure + maxSpeculativeSpan,
                             maxPrefillChunk) / pageSize)

so residency measured in chunks is `max(1032, chunk) / chunk`, which
decays toward 1 as the chunk grows:

    chunk  512  (shipping default) -> ring   65 pages = 1040 tok = 2.03 chunks
    chunk 1024                     -> ring   65 pages = 1040 tok = 1.02 chunks
    chunk 2048                     -> ring  128 pages = 2048 tok = 1.00 chunks

At the shipping chunk there are two chunks of slack. At any chunk at or
above the window there is essentially NONE — raising the chunk raises the
ring by exactly as much, so a block written early in a chunk is nearly
lapped by the end of that same chunk.

> **A capture pass must run WITHIN the chunk that wrote the block.** A
> design that captures "at the next chunk boundary" is correct at 512 and
> silently wrong at 1024 — no error, just missing blocks and a quiet
> fallback to replay.

`maxPrefillChunk` is already a lockstep parameter in production
(`EngineV2Factory+Production.swift:657-667`). Treat chunk size as an INPUT
to the capture design, not a knob tuned afterward.

**The remedy is structural, not disciplinary.** vLLM never has this hazard
because free, allocate and capture happen inside ONE call:
`kv_cache_manager.py:500` runs `remove_skipped_blocks`, then allocation,
then `:559` runs `cache_blocks` — all in the same invocation of
`allocate_slots`, with the free deliberately ordered first ("call this
function before allocating new blocks to reduce the number of evicted
blocks", `:496-497`).

So a block is always inserted into the hash map in the same step that
allocated it, before anything can reclaim it. **There is no window in
which a written-but-uncaptured block can be lost.**

Adopting that ordering — capture in the same call that writes, never on a
later boundary — removes the chunk-size coupling as a CORRECTNESS concern
and leaves it as a residency-tuning one. That is the shape to build.

**But the unit captured synchronously must be the HANDLE, not the bytes.**
Our donation path is deliberately split across two threads, for a
paged-specific reason: `retire`/`enqueueDonation` build snapshot handles
on the ENGINE thread — graph-only, so views over the shared slabs stay
consistent with in-flight writes — then hand hashing, indexing and
materialisation to a serial `donationQueue`
(`EngineLoopV2.swift:467-468`, build at `:2061-2106`, hand-off at
`:2109-2124`). Materialisation is not optional:
`PagedKVBackend.requiresMaterializedSnapshots` is `true` (`:508`) because
donated views reference live slab pages that are recycled the moment the
donor's state is released.

So "capture the block when you write it" read literally would drag a
device `eval` onto the step thread, once per block per layer during
prefill — precisely what today's design routes around.

The resolution is that our existing split is already the right one:
**build the graph slice inline on the engine thread (cheap, no eval) and
hand materialisation off.** Applied per-block-as-filled instead of once at
retire, that satisfies the ordering property — the handle is captured in
the same call that wrote it, before anything can lap it — without moving
device work onto the step. The lazy handle pins nothing; only the later
eval does.

### A sixth delta: our prefill chunk is not vLLM's `max_num_batched_tokens`

`pageDemand` routes sliding layers straight through `ringPageCount`, and
`pageDemand` is both the admission charge and the row's hard cap. Wiring
confirmed: `maxPrefillChunk: schedulerConfig.prefillChunkSize`
(`EngineV2Factory+Production.swift:667`). So the chain is:

> scheduler's prefill chunk -> ring page count -> per-row page demand ->
> KV admission capacity

vLLM's `max_num_batched_tokens` is a PURE scheduling knob — it does not
size the KV pool at all, block count comes from available memory, and
their tuning doc actively recommends raising it above 8192 for throughput.

Ours is not free in the same way. Below the `maxWindowExposure +
maxSpeculativeSpan` term (~1032) the window dominates and the chunk is
genuinely free — which is where production sits at 512. **Above it, every
further token of chunk inflates the ring on all 25 sliding layers, per
row, charged at admission.** The knob starts buying step-level throughput
with admitted concurrency.

So vLLM's published tuning advice does not port unchanged: for us the
ITL/TTFT trade becomes a concurrency trade past that threshold. Anyone
tuning our chunk for tail latency needs it as a third axis.

Both this and the capture hazard share one root, and it is the honest
architectural difference underneath them: **on our side the prefill chunk
size is a LOCKSTEP parameter coupling the scheduler to KV geometry. vLLM
has no such coupling anywhere.**

**Scoping, because the two shipping models land on OPPOSITE sides of the
threshold.** `ringPageCount` takes a `max`, so the chunk is inert until it
exceeds the window term — and at the shipping chunk of 512:

    gemma-4  w=1024 chunk= 512 -> max=1032 ->  65 pages   window-bound
             w=1024 chunk=1024 -> max=1032 ->  65 pages   still inert
             w=1024 chunk=2048 -> max=2048 -> 128 pages   now binding

    gpt-oss  w= 128 chunk= 512 -> max= 512 ->  32 pages   CHUNK-BOUND
             w= 128 chunk=1024 -> max=1024 ->  64 pages   linear already
             w= 128 chunk=2048 -> max=2048 -> 128 pages   4x the charge

> So "prefill chunk feeds admission capacity" is **true on gpt-oss and
> false on gemma-4 at shipping values.** On gemma-4 there are 520 tokens
> of slack before the knob costs anything; on gpt-oss every token is

Taking the coupling as general would over-restrict gemma-4 tuning and
under-restrict gpt-oss. The guidance is: **check `max(window + 8, chunk)`
before changing `prefillChunkSize`.**

The pool already documents both regimes — `checkedRingPageCount`
deliberately checks the cache bound and the row bound SEPARATELY and
refuses to derive one from the other (`PagedKVPool.swift:543-580`), naming
exactly this: "window 1024, chunk 512 -> cache-bound; window 128, chunk
2048 -> row-bound."

---

## The unifying statement

vLLM's capture **is not a data movement at all.** `cache_full_blocks`
(`block_pool.py:225-300`) does nothing but insert `hash -> block-object`
mappings and queue events; the hashes are precomputed on the Request from
token ids; there are **zero tensor operations anywhere in the path.** The
KV bytes are already in the block.

That is why vLLM can afford to capture inline on the scheduler thread
every single step, and why it needs no handle / eval / queue apparatus at
all.

Our capture needs a handle-then-materialise split **only because we
materialise a snapshot into separate storage.** If pages were shared by
pointer, capture would collapse to bookkeeping for us too, and the entire
donation-thread machinery would be unnecessary.

So the recommendations compose more tightly than the ranking above
suggests. Block sharing does not merely lift the disk ceiling and improve
coverage:

> **it deletes the reason capture is expensive in the first place.**

Every finding in this document reduces to one root: **we move KV bytes
where vLLM moves references.** The 25,600-token floor, the tiling
requirement, the 200 MiB sidecars, the 20 GiB ceiling, the two-thread
donation split, and `retainPage`'s zero callers are six symptoms of that
single choice.

---

## Three corrections to the sections above

### "Pure scheduling knob" is wrong — the delta is narrower and sharper

`max_num_batched_tokens` DOES size storage in vLLM: the encoder cache
(`config/scheduler.py:239-240`), LoRA static buffers captured in the
`torch.compile` graph (`:211`), Inductor's 32- vs 64-bit indexing choice
(`:213`), and it is baked into the compilation cache key (`:216`) — so
changing it invalidates compiled artifacts.

The accurate contrast:

> **vLLM's token budget sizes ancillary buffers and the compile key, but
> never the KV cache** — KV blocks come from a pool sized by memory
> profiling / `gpu_memory_utilization`, independent of the token budget.
> **Ours feeds `ringPageCount -> pageDemand -> admission capacity`.**

Both knobs have storage consequences. Only ours has KV-admission
consequences.

### gpt-oss has NO capture headroom, ever

The regime split applies to the capture rule too, and it is worse than the
gemma-4 table implies. On gpt-oss the ring IS the chunk at every setting,
because the window term never binds — so slack is **1.00 chunk at every
chunk size**. A block written at the start of a 512-token chunk is exactly
lapped by the end of that same chunk.

So "capture within the chunk that wrote the block" is not a safety margin
on gpt-oss, it is **the only correct design from day one**, and the
handle-inline/materialise-off-thread split stops being an optimisation and
becomes mandatory. A capture design validated only on gemma-4 will pass
and then silently drop blocks on gpt-oss.

### THE HAZARD: per-block capture must not simply drop the pin

"The lazy handle pins nothing; only the later eval does" was offered as a
benefit. **It is also the hazard, and it is the one way this
recommendation becomes a correctness bug.**

Today's safety comes precisely FROM pinning: the donor's state is held
until `donate()` returns (`EngineLoopV2.swift:2124`), and the
materialising eval runs inside `donate` on the `.utility` donation queue
(`PrefixCacheV2.swift:329-337`).

Remove the pin and nothing stops the ring lapping the page before its eval
completes — and the ring laps in ~2 chunks at chunk 512 on gemma-4 and
~1 chunk on gpt-oss, racing a **deprioritised serial queue**. The failure
is silent: a donated entry referencing recycled pages is **other requests'
bytes**. That is exactly the hazard `requiresMaterializedSnapshots` exists
to prevent.

> **Per-block capture needs an explicit deadline or retention, not just
> synchronous handle capture.** Design it in from the start.

This does not change the ranking. It changes what "done" means for the
producer item, and it is the single place where a plausible-looking
implementation of these findings would ship a data-corruption bug.

## Both models, measured

| | gemma-4-26B-A4B | gpt-oss-20b |
|---|---|---|
| layout | 25 sliding (w=1024) + 5 full | 12 sliding (w=128) + 12 full |
| bytes/token/layer | 8192 sliding vs 4096 full — **asymmetric** | 2048 vs 2048 — **symmetric** |
| block scaling | full scales to 32 | none needed |
| kv_cache_groups | **6** (5 sliding + 1 full) | **2** (1 sliding + 1 full) |
| **min prefix reuse** | **32 tokens** | **16 tokens** |
| vs our 25,600 | **800x** | **1600x** |
| p50 979 tok | 960 reusable (98.1%) | 976 reusable (99.7%) |

**gpt-oss is the easier case on every axis and has the larger ratio.**
Symmetric head geometry means no block-size scaling, so the floor is a
flat 16; the 128-token window makes the contiguous-run requirement 8
blocks rather than 64; and group formation collapses it to 2 groups
against gemma-4's 6. **If we want a first target for capture-as-they-fill,
gpt-oss has the smallest surface and the largest payoff.**

Note the group count is not "one table per attention type" — it is set by
the REPEATING PATTERN. gemma-4's 25:5 gives `group_size` 5 and therefore
six tables; gpt-oss's 1:1 alternating gives twelve and therefore two. Same
code path, and it is what keeps per-block residency at 1x rather than
N-layers x in both cases.

Both models' contiguous-run requirement (1024 and 128 tokens) binds ONLY
above the window — which our p50 of 979 is not, for either model. **At
typical traffic neither model ever meets the window as a floor.**

One tension worth naming: gpt-oss is the best target for the prefix-reuse
work AND the worst for the capture hazard, since its ring is chunk-bound
at every setting with zero slack. The two facts point at the same
implementation — handle captured inline, materialisation off-thread with
an explicit deadline — which is required there and merely correct on
gemma-4.

---

## The hazard is solved upstream — vLLM's offload tier has our exact problem

The section above calls per-block capture "the single place where a
plausible implementation ships a data-corruption bug," and prescribes an
explicit deadline or retention. **There is a cheaper answer, and vLLM
already runs it** — in its GPU -> CPU -> storage offloading tier, which is
the one place vLLM also has bytes to move and therefore hits the same
"index entry exists before its bytes are readable" problem we do.

- Lookup is **tri-state**: MISS / HIT_PENDING / HIT
  (`kv_offload/cpu/manager.py:130-140`), HIT_PENDING when the block is not
  yet ready.
- Readiness is encoded in the **sign of the refcount**: `is_ready` is
  `ref_cnt >= 0` (`kv_offload/cpu/policies/base.py:29-33`), and blocks are constructed
  at `ref_cnt = -1` — "initialize block as 'not ready'" (`:24-25`). One
  signed int carries all three states: **-1 store in flight, 0 resident
  and evictable, >0 pinned during transfer.**
- Stated as design principle at `kv_offload/tiering/manager.py:15-20`:
  "Transparent retry mechanism — return None from `lookup()` to signal
  'data is being promoted, try later'", and "`ref_cnt` as eviction
  protection".

**So the synchronous unit is smaller than a handle — it is a NAME.**
Publish the block's name inline at write time in a not-ready state
(integers only, on the step thread), then let handle construction and
materialisation finish off-thread and flip the entry ready. An adopter
that arrives early gets pending and falls back to compute — the same
graceful degradation already measured for LRU eviction, **not a
correctness hazard.**

Ordering: **name inline -> handle + eval off-thread -> entry flips ready.**
That is the cheapest of the three, which matters most on gpt-oss, where
there is exactly one chunk of slack at every setting.

### And a correction to the unifying statement

"We move bytes where vLLM moves references" is true of vLLM's in-GPU path
and is why its `cache_full_blocks` is free. But it is not a thread-model
advantage: **the moment vLLM has bytes to move, it grows the same
machinery we have** — async transfer, eviction protection, readiness
states.

So our donation-queue design is not a deficiency. **It is what this
problem looks like when the tier is real.** What we are missing is not the
architecture; it is the readiness protocol that lets the cheap part happen
inline.

**Why step 1 is safe, stated precisely:** publishing the name touches no
pages, so **it cannot be lapped.** That removes the chunk-size coupling
from the CORRECTNESS path entirely — it survives only as residency tuning
on stages 2 and 3. This is a strictly weaker synchronous requirement than
"capture the handle inline," and it is what makes the design safe on
gpt-oss, where there is no ring slack at any chunk size.

Corrected staging for capture-as-they-fill:

    1. publish the NAME inline        step thread, integer state only  <- only synchronous part
    2. build handle + materialise     existing engine/donationQueue split
    3. flip the entry to ready

Stage 2 is still required: our bytes genuinely move, and that is not a
defect — it is what the problem looks like whenever a durable tier is
real. vLLM's main-path capture is free solely because block == storage
there.

And the caution that survives: pointer sharing removes the cost from the
step path and removes the tiling requirement, **but not from persistence.
The 200 MiB changes character rather than vanishing.**

**The design economy, read first-hand at
`vllm/v1/kv_offload/cpu/policies/base.py:20-33`:** the tri-state is not an
enum and not a separate flag. It is ONE `ctypes.c_int32`:

```python
_fields_ = [("ref_cnt", ctypes.c_int32), ("block_id", ctypes.c_int64)]
...
# initialize block as "not ready" (ref_cnt = -1)
self.ref_cnt = -1
...
def is_ready(self) -> bool:
    return self.ref_cnt >= 0
```

The **sign** carries readiness; the **magnitude** carries pin count. They
reused the field that already does eviction protection rather than adding
state — the same economy as `block_pool`'s ref_cnt doubling as
"in the free queue or not." Worth copying as-is: our equivalent would not
need a new field either.

### A citation hazard for whoever implements this

The readiness code was first cited here as `kv_offload/base.py`. That file
EXISTS — 17.5 KB, holding the `OffloadKey`/`LoadStoreSpec` surface — so
the wrong path resolves to a real file and reads as plausible rather than
erroring. Two of the three bad citations in this investigation had that
shape: **wrong-but-resolvable**, not missing.

Same class as the four-tree `cwd` trap recorded above. When lifting a
line-number citation out of this document, re-resolve the path before
acting on it; a successful `read` is not evidence the path was the
intended one.

### Citations in this document were machine-verified

Every `.py` citation above was checked against the clone: file resolves,
line range is in bounds, and for the load-bearing ones the anchor text
actually falls inside the cited range (whitespace-normalised across the
window, because docstrings wrap and a naive single-line match reports
false failures on correct citations).

Result: 17 distinct citations, **one defect** — `scheduler.py:717` was
both off by one (the predicate is at 718) and ambiguous, since the clone
holds five files named `scheduler.py`. Corrected to
`vllm/v1/core/sched/scheduler.py:718`.

The general failure mode, worth knowing before trusting any citation in a
message stream: **anchors sit a few lines BEFORE the cited start**,
because it is natural to cite a function's body while quoting its
docstring header. That is invisible on re-reading, since the surrounding
code looks right either way. Bare basenames compound it — `scheduler.py`
is not a citation in a tree with five of them.

### Two working rules, learned expensively

Every agent on this investigation independently audited its own citations
at the end. Combined: **~190 citations checked, 19 range slips, 1 wrong
path, 0 fabrications.** Every quoted string was real; only ranges drifted,
and always in the same direction. Two rules fall out.

**1. Anchor line numbers to `grep`, never to a position counted inside a
rendered `read`.** Those outputs elide regions with `…`, and hand-counting
silently absorbs the elision. Every one of the 19 slips was hand-counted;
every grep-derived citation passed. Drift ran 1-22 lines, always with the
cited start landing *before* the quoted anchor — which is invisible on
re-reading, because the surrounding code looks right either way. The
natural error is citing a function's body while quoting its docstring
header.

**2. Escape regex metacharacters when searching for literal code.**
Unescaped `( ) [ ] . * + ? |` silently change the query: searching
`range(max_num_blocks - 1, -1, -1)` parses the parens as a capture group
and matches text that does not exist, returning a confident false
negative. Use fixed-string mode, or escape. This produced a false "grep is
unreliable" conclusion that was itself retracted — and had it stood, it
would have caused a *true* negative to be discarded.

**3. Cite `git grep <pat> HEAD -- <path>`, not the working tree.** The
grep rule above has a blind spot: a grep against a MUTATING worktree is
valid only until the next agent's edit lands. An agent's `EngineLoopV2`
citations were correct when taken and two lines off an hour later, through
no error of theirs. HEAD is stable; the worktree is not.

**4. Verify against content, never against the message that claims it.**
Two people independently mis-reported a file's state this session by
reading a commit message or a peer's summary of their own change instead
of the file. Both were confident and both were wrong.

Worked example of all four failing at once, recorded because it is mine.
Asked whether a doc's "provider returns 503, coordinator reroutes" claim
was citable, I ran `grep StatusServiceUnavailable coordinator/api/*.go |
head -6`, saw six billing hits, and concluded the inference path had none.
The `head -6` truncated an alphabetical list exactly where
`billing_handlers.go` ends — twelve non-billing files carry it, and
`consumer.go` alone has 19 sites. I then grepped the identifiers
`requeue|reroute`, got zero, and called the behaviour absent; it exists as
the "unbounded fault-failover ladder" with a `dispatch_to_capacity_503`
counter. I asserted a citation had been dropped without opening the file —
it was present. And I quoted a guard at `:586` read from a worktree five
agents were editing; HEAD said `:543`. Four rules, four violations, inside
one message that was itself recording rule 3.

The claim was substantially TRUE. Removing it was still right, for a
different reason: a provider-side quickstart should not assert
coordinator routing behaviour. Recording the correct reason matters,
because the next person to need that path will grep for it, find it, and
rightly distrust everything around it.

**5. Cite what survives the refactor.** Rule 3 says cite HEAD, but HEAD
is not enough when a file is actively being rewritten. An anchor was taken
against HEAD, verified correct, and was dead minutes later when the file's
owner removed 253 lines — the knob it named was only ever *described*
there, never implemented. Cite the definition site that survives, or cite
by symbol and let the reader grep. This is the same class as the defect
that ticket was fixing: a docstring number no code could reach.

Corollary worth keeping: **a negative needs a control.** "Symbol absent
from file A" is only evidence once the same single-branch pattern is shown
to match in sibling file B. Two load-bearing negatives here
(`retainPage` has no callers; FlashAttention never sets
`reorder_batch_threshold`) were re-established that way after the scare.

# Why MTP is slow on paged — measured

Root-caused at gemma-4-26B-A4B geometry (30 layers, 25 sliding w=1024/hd=256
+ 5 full hd=512, 16 query heads), B=1, fp16, M4 Max, 7 paired in-process
reps, shipping config (`partitionTargetDefault = 0`).

| | paged | contiguous | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| rectangular verify, k=3, ctx=1024 | **7.339 ms** | **5.122 ms** | **+2.217 ms** |

The reported engine gap was 16.422 − 14.214 = +2.208 ms. **The KV layer
alone accounts for 100.4% of it** — nothing left for the model body, the
drafter, or finalize bookkeeping.

## The paged kernel is BETTER, and that is why it loses

OLS over columns ∈ {1,2,3,4,6,8}:

    paged       1.464 + 1.4843 × cols     (49.5 µs per column per layer)
    contiguous  2.831 + 0.5827 × cols     (19.4 µs per column per layer)

Paged's FIXED cost is **lower** (1.46 vs 2.83 ms). Its marginal cost is
**2.55× steeper**. Break-even is **1.52 columns**, so paged wins at k=0 —
plain decode, which is 100% of production today — and loses at every
k ≥ 1, linearly worse with k. That is the direct explanation of the sign
flip: forcing k=1 gives **+14.7% on contiguous and −5.8% on paged.**

It is not a worse kernel. It is a kernel optimised for the wrong shape of
work, and MTP is the only thing that asks for the wrong shape:
`PagedAttentionKernel.decode` is TWO dispatches (part + merge), so a k=3
round issues `2 × (1+k) × 30 = 240` where contiguous issues 120 slice
SDPAs.

## Two ablations rule out the obvious answers

**Not bandwidth.** Paged verify is FLAT across a 16× context sweep
(9.77 / 9.77 / 7.72 / 6.98 / 8.34 ms at ctx 256→4096) while contiguous
grows monotonically (3.79 → 5.94). Excess KV traffic would scale with
context. It does not.

**Not occupancy.** A PTOK target A/B at 0/32/128/512 shows no material
benefit (best is 3.6%, inside noise). Split-K partition sizing is not the
lever — and re-enabling adaptation would reintroduce the batch-composition
nondeterminism `partitionTargetDefault = 0` was just landed to remove.

## Attribution of the 2.217 ms

| term | ms | share |
|---|---:|---:|
| extra dispatch PAIRS from the per-column loop | ~2.0 | **~90%** |
| drafter capture gather materialisation | ~0.14 | ~6% |
| per-column seqinfo host→device uploads | 0.07 | 3.2% |
| `CBv2MTPCaptureFence` full-tensor `sum()` | ~0.03 | ~1.5% |

## Four premises disproved — including two of mine

- **Rollback is not the cost.** The paged transaction is bookkeeping only;
  no staging buffer exists. Ironically *contiguous* is the backend that
  stages.
- **`maxSpeculativeSpan` headroom is not the cost.** Static geometry
  checked at plan time — host integer comparisons.
- **Page-table updates are not the cost.** `tableVersion` bumps only when
  `ensurePage` appends; at most one of the 1+k columns can bump, on
  ~(1+k)/16 of rounds.
- **No extra device pass for rejected drafts.** Page release is deferred to
  a single drain over a normally-empty array.

## Ranked fixes

1. **Batch the 1+k verify columns into ONE paged dispatch per layer.**
   Blocking for shipping MTP-on with paged. Hoist the KV write out of the
   column loop (one `write` already scatters n tokens in a single
   dispatch), then pack columns onto the kernel's batch axis. 3 dispatches
   per layer instead of 8 at k=3. **No Metal changes.** Requires a parity
   test that packed output is bit-identical to the per-column loop.
   *Medium, ~150 lines.*
2. **Reduce the CaptureFence `sum()` to a one-element probe.** The edge it
   publishes ALREADY EXISTS — `PagedKVPool.gather` publishes an identical
   back-edge with a single element, and its own comment says so. Currently
   reads ~13 MiB to establish a dependency a 4-byte read already
   established. *Trivial, one expression.*
3. Cache per-column seqinfo — **do not do separately**, subsumed by 1.
4. Tune PTOK — **do not do.** Measured null, and it would undo the
   invariance fix.

## Landing order matters, and getting it wrong regresses paged

The depth-controller accounting bug and this penalty are fully independent
— one changes WHICH k is chosen, the other what a chosen k COSTS. But:

> **Land the paged verify fix BEFORE the depth-controller fix.**

Fixing the controller alone pushes it toward k ≥ 1, which is exactly where
paged is genuinely slower. That would regress the backend this release is
named for. After fix 1 the cost curve is flat enough in k that the
corrected controller's deeper speculation is profitable on both backends.
